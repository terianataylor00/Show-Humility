          Show Humility is not a religious event, nor a fundraising initiative.
          It is a simple, profound act of humility.

          When you mention the movement to the people, two reactions are common: some pause, smile, and say “I get it” — and immediately want to be involved. Others shy away from the act of humility. Interestingly, head teachers consulted about the initiative were enthusiastic, seeing it as a meaningful way to engage their pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
          The washed will include school children, prisoners, families, workers of all kinds, the homeless — in fact, people like you and me. No one is excluded, and all are welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The movement was founded by John Jeffcock, who first attempted to launch it in London in 2012 and 2014, but struggled to find a venue. Attempts continued through the years until the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, in 2025, momentum returned: the CEO of the Battersea Power Station generously offered its front lawn as a venue, and Thames Water stepped in to provide the water. With this support, washer recruitment could begin in earnest once again.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The washing of feet is an ancient tradition found across many faiths and cultures. It appears in all three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam — and is also practiced in Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. The meaning varies: in some traditions it represents humility, in others leadership, cleansing, or the expelling of evil or negative energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In history, the act has also been tied to leadership and monarchy. Mary I of England (1556–1558), for example, washed the feet of 41 poor women — one for each year of her life — kneeling as she did so. Most sources record that James II of England (1633–1701) was the last English monarch to personally wash the feet of the poor. At the time, it was customary for Yeomen to pre-wash the feet before they reached the monarch.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Show Humility events, however, there will be no pre-washing — the act is performed directly, in its purest and most meaningful form.
